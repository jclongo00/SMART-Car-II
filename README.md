# SMART-Car-II

This is the Git hub repo for the LMU SMART Car II Senior Capstone project. 

This repo contains the fundamental code such as:
- userInterface.py
- main_controller.py

The userInterface.py file is built for a small 7" touch screen but is useable on any screen.
The main_controller.py file is to control the specific motor and servo for the remote-control (RC) car that was chosen for the project.
